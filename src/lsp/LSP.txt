The Liskov Substitution Principle is a concept in programming that states
that objects of a derived class should be able to be used in place of objects
of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program.
In simpler terms, if you have a class and you create a new class that
inherits from it, you should be able to replace objects of the new class
wherever you were using objects of the old class, and everything should
still work correctly.
